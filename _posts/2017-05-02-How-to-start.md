So.. to find the theory is not a problem.

But where to get practice?

I started from the courses of ["Successful testers"](http://software-testing.ru/edu/1-schedule/56-school) with Natalia Rukol.

I know somebody will say that the courses are just a waste of money and that being self-motivated and organized you may progress without any courses.
Maybe it is, but it was my own way to start and I felt that with the teacher it'll be easier and faster.

But the most important came after courses when I was chosen in a [team of testers](http://software-testing.ru/forum/index.php?/topic/32854-kak-nachat/) to work on real projects. Here the practice came.
We used to use different bug tracking systems: Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine, Mantis... and applied testing via [Whittaker's test tours](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Whittaker-Exploratory-Software-Testing-Tips-Tricks-Tours-and-Techniques-to-Guide-Test-Design/PGM23159.html), provided different sorts of testing and had fun!

Just after that I registered in different freelance portals as [utest](https://www.utest.com/), [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/?vt_cmp=249489065&vt_adg=19670625305&vt_src=google&vt_kw=upwork&vt_device=c&gclid=CjwKEAjw3KDIBRCz0KvZlJ7k4TgSJABDqOK7CSK7pW7mmGe733zxASF8IglAnlJU3RRcAVDW0wFo_hoC4wDw_wcB), [test.io](https://test.io/) and started to use knowledge in my work at Tsar Voyages.

Now we came in the USA and I continue to work on freelance projects, looking for a full-time job and at the same time continue my self-education in the programming world.

I will share the useful links and interesting webinars that I liked.
