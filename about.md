<p>Do you like languages as I do? </p>
<p>I mean just languages…(Russian, French, English..) </p>
<p>I started from them and now I like other languages as Java, Python...etc</p>
Graduated from linguistic University in 2011 I started programming learning just a year ago.
I know you will say “First mistake, - she mentioned experience do not connected to programming and QA”. But… of course I made it on purpose.
I just wanna show how different are the ways to IT world and that you can start learning right now and you will have the time to become somebody who makes difference.
I just truly believe that everything is possible and that a hard worker who loves learn and discover as I Am have all chances to get the purpose and become an awesome QA.
