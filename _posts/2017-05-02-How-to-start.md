So to find the theory is not a problem.

But where to get the practice?

I started from the courses of ["Successful testers"](http://software-testing.ru/edu/1-schedule/56-school) with Natalia Rukol.
I know somebody will tell that the courses it is just vast of money and that being self-motivated and organized it is possible to progress without courses.
Maybe it is, but it was my way to start and I felt that with the coacher it'll be easier and faster.

But the most important came after courses when I was selected in a [team of testers](http://software-testing.ru/forum/index.php?/topic/32854-kak-nachat/) to work on real projects, so here the practice came.
We use to use different bug tracking systems : Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine, Mantis... applied testing via [Whittaker's test tours](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Whittaker-Exploratory-Software-Testing-Tips-Tricks-Tours-and-Techniques-to-Guide-Test-Design/PGM23159.html), provided different sorts of testing and had fun!

Just after I registered in different freelance portals as [utest](https://www.utest.com/), [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/?vt_cmp=249489065&vt_adg=19670625305&vt_src=google&vt_kw=upwork&vt_device=c&gclid=CjwKEAjw3KDIBRCz0KvZlJ7k4TgSJABDqOK7CSK7pW7mmGe733zxASF8IglAnlJU3RRcAVDW0wFo_hoC4wDw_wcB), [test.io](https://test.io/)

And started to use knowledges in my work at Tsar Voyages.
