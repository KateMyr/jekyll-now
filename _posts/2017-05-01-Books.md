title: Time to start. Books
---


It was some time ago I spent my evening with Roman.

Savin, of course, what did you think?

And his well known book [Teстирование DOT COM](http://adm-lib.ru/testirovanie/testirovanie-dot-com.html).

I think many testers start with this one.

After that it was time of Mr. Kaner with [Testing computer Software](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Kaner/dp/0471358460) and Boris Beizer with [Black Box Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Testing-Techniques-Functional-Software/dp/0471120944)

And just many google pages as [ISTQB EXAM CERTIFICATION](http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-a-software-testing/) or [List of books and tutorials](https://tproger.ru/digest/free-software-testing-books/)

Nowadays it is not a problem to find the information, there are so many good youtube channels, webinars and tutorials.

The most important - to find the practice.
