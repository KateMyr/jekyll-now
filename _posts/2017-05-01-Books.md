title: Time to start. Books

It was some time ago, I spent my evening with Roman.

Savin, of course, what did you think?

And his well known book [Teстирование DOT COM](http://adm-lib.ru/testirovanie/testirovanie-dot-com.html).

I think many testers start with this one.

After ithat t was time of Mr. Kaner with [Testing computer Software](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Kaner/dp/0471358460) and Boris Beizer with [Black Box Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Testing-Techniques-Functional-Software/dp/0471120944)
