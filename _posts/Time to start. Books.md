title: Time to start. Books
---


<p>It was some times ago, I spent my evening with Roman.</p>
<p> Savin, of course, what did you think? </p>
<p> and his well known book [Teстирование DOT COM](http://adm-lib.ru/testirovanie/testirovanie-dot-com.html)</p>
<p> I think many testers start with this one.</p>
<p> After it was time of Mr. Kaner with [Testing computer Software](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Kaner/dp/0471358460) and Boris Beizer with [Black Box Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Testing-Techniques-Functional-Software/dp/0471120944)</p>
